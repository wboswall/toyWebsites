   <p>As the Moon orbits the Earth the portion we see illuminated changes
      from day to day. The start of each phase occurs with the 
      <b>new Moon</b> in which the Moon does not appear illuminated from 
      the Earth. The Moon takes 27.3 days to orbit Earth, but the 
      lunar phase cycle (from new Moon to new Moon) is 29.5 days. 
      This is because the Moon spends an extra 2.2 days "catching up" as 
      the Earth travels about 45 million miles around the Sun 
      during the time the Moon completes one orbit around Earth.</p>

   <p>Astronomers often refer to a <b>Lunar Calendar</b> to track the phases 
      of the Moon. Generally astronomers do not want to observe the night sky 
      during those times the Moon is highly illuminated because moonlight can 
      obscure the light from fainter objects such as stars, planets, and
      nebulae. Below is a sample Lunar Calendar for the current month. 
      Happy Moon-gazing!</p>
