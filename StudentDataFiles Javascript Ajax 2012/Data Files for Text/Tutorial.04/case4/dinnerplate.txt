Summer Entertainment Tips
-------------------------
With the summer fast approaching, it's time to start planning outdoor parties. Keep
your guests cool and happy with the summertime tips.

 * Keep plenty of ice on hand for cooling people, food, and drinks by filling plastic 
   freezer bags with ice from your trays. 
 * For extra flavor, use frozen cubes of lemonade or juice to cool drinks 
   instead of regular ice. 
 * Keep a bag packed with picnic gear for spur-of-the-moment excursions. 
 * Throw a summer harvest party to swap surplus fruits and vegetables with your 
   gardener friends. 
 * Stock extras for guests including sunblock, bug repellant, hats, and towels

Grilling Tips
-------------
Is there anything better on the grill than beef? To get the most out of steaks, apply the
following tips:

* For direct grilling place beef 3 to 6 inches from the heat source and cook 
  at medim heat.
* For thicker cuts, use indirect grilling with the beef placed farther than 6 inches
  from the heat source.
* Leave at least 1/8" of fat in your steaks to help seal in the juices while the
  meat is cooking. Slash the fat at 1" intervals aroundthe steak perimeter so that
  the meat will not curl up during the grilling process.
