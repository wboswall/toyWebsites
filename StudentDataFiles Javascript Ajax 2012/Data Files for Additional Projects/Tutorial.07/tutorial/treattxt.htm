      <h1>Preamble</h1>
      <p>THE parties being desirous of establishing permanent peace and 
         friendship between the United States and the said Creek Nation, and 
         the citizens and members thereof, and to remove the causes of war by 
         ascertaining their limits, and making other necessary, just and 
         friendly arrangements: The President of the United States, by Henry 
         Knox, Secretary for the Department of War, whom he hath constituted with 
         full powers for these purposes, by and with the advice and consent of 
         the Senate of the United States, and the Creek Nation, by the 
         undersigned Kings, Chiefs and Warriors, representing the said nation, 
         have agreed to the following articles. </p>

      <h1>Articles</h1>
      <h2>Article I</h2>
      <p>There shall be perpetual peace and friendship between all the citizens 
         of the United States of America, and all the individuals, towns and 
         tribes of the Upper, Middle and Lower Creeks and Semanolies composing 
         the Creek nation of Indians.</p>

      <h2>Article II</h2>
      <p>The undersigned Kings, Chiefs and Warriors, for themselves and all 
         parts of the Creek Nation within the limits of the United States, do 
         acknowledge themselves, and the said parts of the Creek nation, to be 
         under the protection of the United States of America, and of no other 
         sovereign whosoever; and they also stipulate that the said Creek Nation 
         will not hold any treaty with an individual State, or with individuals 
         of any State. </p>

      <h2>Article III</h2>
      <p>The Creek Nation shall deliver as soon as practicable to the commanding 
         officer of the troops of the United States, stationed at the Rock-Landing 
         on the Oconee river, all citizens of the United States, white inhabitants 
         or negroes, who are now prisoners in any part of the said nation. And if 
         any such prisoners or negroes should not be so delivered, on or before the 
         first day of June ensuing, the governor of Georgia may empower three persons 
         to repair to the said nation, in order to claim and receive such prisoners 
         and negroes. </p>

      <h2>Article IV</h2>
      <p>The boundary between the citizens of the United States and the Creek 
         Nation is, and shall be, from where the old line strikes the river 
         Savannah; thence up the said river to a place on the most northern branch 
         of the same, commonly called the Keowee, where a north east line to be drawn 
         from the top of the Occunna mountain shall intersect; thence along the said 
         line in a south-west direction to Tupelo river; thence to the top of the 
         Currahee mountain; thence to the head or source of the main south branch of 
         the Oconee river, called the Appalachee; thence down the middle of the said 
         main south branch and river Oconee, to its confluence with the Oakmulgee, 
         which form the river Altamaha; and thence down the middle of the said Altamaha 
         to the old line on the said river, and thence along the said old line to the 
         river St. Mary's. </p>
      <p>And in order to preclude forever all disputes relatively to the head or 
         source of the main south branch of the river Oconee, at the place where it 
         shall be intersected by the line aforesaid, from the Currahee mountain, the 
         same shall be ascertained by an able surveyor on the part of the United States, 
         who shall be assisted by three old citizens of Georgia, who may be appointed by 
         the Governor of the said state, and three old Creek chiefs, to be appointed by 
         the said nation; and the said surveyor, citizens and chiefs shall assemble for 
         this purpose, on the first day of October, one thousand one hundred and 
         ninety-one, at the Rock Landing on the said rigor Oconee, and thence proceed 
         to ascertain the said head or source of the main south branch of the said river, 
         at the place where It shall be intersected by the line aforesaid, to be drawn 
         from the Currahee mountain. And in order that the said boundary shall be rendered 
         distinct and well known, it shall be marked by a line of felled trees at least 
         twenty feet wide, and the trees chopped on each side from the said Currahee 
         mountain, to the head or source of the said main south branch of the Oconee 
         river, and thence down the margin of the said main south branch and river Oconee 
         for the distance of twenty miles, or as much farther as may be necessary to 
         mark distinctly the said boundary. And in order to extinguish forever all 
         claims of the Creek nation, or any part thereof, to any of the land lying to 
         the northward and eastward of the boundary herein described, it is hereby 
         agreed, in addition to the considerations heretofore made for the said land, 
         that the United States will cause certain valuable Indian goods now in the 
         state of Georgia, to be delivered to the said Creek nation; and the said 
         United States will also cause the sum of one thousand and five hundred dollars 
         to be paid annually to the said Creek nation. And the undersigned Kings, 
         Chiefs and Warriors, do hereby for themselves and the whole Creek nation, 
         their heirs and descendants, for the considerations above-mentioned, 
         release, quit claim, relinquish and cede, all the land to the northward and 
         eastward of the boundary herein described. </p>

      <h2>Article V</h2>
      <p>The United States solemnly guarantee to the Creek Nation, all their lands 
         within the limits of the United States to the westward and southward of the 
         boundary described in the preceding article. </p>

      <h2>Article VI</h2>
      <p>If any citizen of the United States, or other person not being an Indian, 
         shall attempt to settle on any of the Creeks lands, such person shall forfeit 
         the protection of the United States, and the Creeks may punish him or not, as
         they please. </p>

      <h2>Article VII</h2>
      <p>No citizen or inhabitant of the United States shall attempt to hunt or 
         destroy the game on the Creek lands: Nor shall any such citizen or inhabitant 
         go into the Creek country, without a passport first obtained from the Governor 
         of some one of the United States, or the officer of the troops of the 
         United States commanding at the nearest military post on the frontiers, or 
         such other person as the President of the United States may, from time to 
         time, authorize to grant the same. </p>

      <h2>Article VIII</h2>
      <p>If any Creek Indian or Indians, or person residing among them, or who shall 
         take refuge in their nation, shall commit a robbery or murder, or other 
         capital crime, on any of the citizens or inhabitants of the United States, 
         the Creek nation, or town, or tribe to which such offender or offenders may 
         belong, shall be bound to deliver him or them up, to be punished according to 
         the laws of the United States. </p>

      <h2>Article IX</h2>
      <p>If any citizen or inhabitant of the United States, or of either of the 
         territorial districts of the United States, shall go into any town, 
         settlement or territory belonging to the Creek nation of Indians, and shall 
         there commit any crime upon, or trespass against the person or property of 
         any peaceable and friendly Indian or Indians, which if committed within the
         jurisdiction of any state, or within the jurisdiction of either of the said 
         districts, against a citizen or white inhabitant thereof, would be punishable 
         by the laws of such state or district, such offender or offenders shall be 
         subject to the same punishment, and shall be proceeded against in the same 
         manner, as if the offence had been committed within the jurisdiction of the 
         state or district to which he or they may belong, against a citizen or white 
         inhabitant thereof. </p>

      <h2>Article X</h2>
      <p>In cases of violence on the persons or property of the individuals of either 
         party, neither retaliation nor reprisal shall be committed by the other, until 
         satisfaction shall have been demanded of the party, of which the aggressor is, 
         and shall have been refused. </p>

      <h2>Article XI</h2>
      <p>The Creeks shall give notice to the citizens of the United States of any 
         designs, which they may know or suspect to be formed in any neighboring tribe, 
         or by any person whatever, against the peace and interests of the United States. 
      </p>

      <h2>Article XII</h2>
      <p>That the Creek nation may be led to a greater degree of civilization, and to 
         become herdsmen and cultivators, instead of remaining in a state of hunters, 
         the United States will from time to time furnish gratuitously the said nation 
         with useful domestic animals and implements of husbandry. And further to 
         assist the said nation in so desirable a pursuit, and at the same time to 
         establish a certain mode of communication, the United States will send such, 
         and so many persons to reside in said nation as they may judge proper, and not
         exceeding four in number, who shall qualify themselves to act as interpreters. 
         These persons shall have lands assigned them by the Creeks for cultivation, for 
         themselves and their successors in office; but they shall be precluded 
         exercising any kind of traffic. </p>

      <h2>Article XIII</h2>
      <p>All animosities for past grievances shall henceforth cease; and the 
         contracting parties will carry the foregoing treaty into full execution, with 
         all good faith and sincerity. </p>

      <h2>Article XIV</h2>
      <p>This treaty shall take effect and be obligatory on the contracting parties, 
         as soon as the same shall have been ratified by the President of the United 
         States, with the advice and consent of the Senate of the United States. </p>

         States of America, and the whole Creek nation, the parties have hereunto set
