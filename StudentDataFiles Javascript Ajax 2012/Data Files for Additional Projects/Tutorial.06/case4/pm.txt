Roosevelt, Theodore (1901 - 09)
===============================
Known as the Bull Moose, Roosevelt was a man of extraordinary discipline 
whose refined and literate tastes helped spawn his fascination with 
the rough and ready worlds of war and wilderness. He is known for ushering in
an era of economic reform and preservation of America's wilderness.

Taft, William H. (1909 - 13)
============================
Taft was Roosevelt's hand-picked successor in the election of 1908. He defeated 
William Jennings Bryan, who was running for the presidency for the third time.
Though he carried on many of Roosevelt's policies, Taft got into increasing trouble 
with the progressive wing of the party. After his defeat in 1912, he became 
chief justice of the United States Supreme Court.

Wilson, Woodrow (1913 - 21)
===========================
In hist first term, Wilson enacted a program of 
domestic reform, including the Federal Reserve Act. Reelected in 
1916 as a peace candidate, he tried to mediate between the 
warring nations; but when the Germans resumed unrestricted submarine warfare in 1917, 
Wilson brought the United States into the war. After the conclusion of the war, he strove 
unsuccessfully to lay the foundations for enduring peace.

Harding, Warren (1921 - 23)
===========================
When the 1920 Republican convention was deadlocked, Harding became the dark-horse nominee 
of his party and easily defeated James M. Cox, his Democratic opponent. His cabinet some 
men manifestly unfit for public office, when they were not corrupt. The impending disclosure 
of the Teapot Dome scandal profoundly worried him. On his return from Alaska in 1923, he died 
unexpectedly in San Francisco.


Coolidge, Calvin (1923 - 29)
============================
After Harding's death, Silent Cal handled the Washington scandals with care and managed 
to save the Republican Party from public blame for the widespread corruption. In 1924, 
Coolidge was elected without difficulty, defeating the Democrat, John W. Davis, and 
Robert M. La Follette running on the Progressive ticket. His second term, like his first, 
was characterized by a booming economy, though not in all sectors of the nation.

Hoover, Herbert (1929 - 33)
===========================
In the election of 1928, Hoover overwhelmed Gov. Alfred E. Smith of New York, the Democratic 
candidate and the first Roman Catholic to run for the presidency. He soon faced the worst 
depression in the nation's history, but his attacks upon it were hampered by his belief
that there were many areas in which the federal government had no power to act. 
After his 1932 defeat, Hoover returned to private business, though throughout his
retirement he headed various world food missions.

Roosevelt, Franklin D. (1933 - 45)
==================================
Defeating Hoover in 1932, Roosevelt promised a New Deal of economic reform, designed to
bring the country out of the Great Depression. His first term was characterized by expansion
of government programs to assist labor, farmers, and the unemployed. Roosevelt became aware of 
the menace to world peace posed by totalitarian fascism, and from 1937 on he tried to focus 
public attention on the trend of events in Europe and Asia. With the outbreak of World War II,
Roosevelt's strove to bring aid to Britain. Finally entering the War after the attack on Pearl
Harbor, Roosevelt was part an international coalition that defeated Germany and Japan.

Truman, Harry (1945 - 53)
=========================
Assuming the presidency upon the death of FDR in 1945, Truman was immediately faced with the problems 
of winding down the war against Germany and Japan. To end the war with Japan, he authorized 
the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. His next years in office included the introduction 
of the Marshall Plan to aid in the economic reconstruction of war-ravaged nations. Truman won reelection in
1948 over Thomas E. Dewey. Truman's second term was primarily concerned with the cold war with 
the Soviet Union, the implementing of NATO, and waging the Korean War.

Eisenhower, Dwight (1953 - 61)
==============================
Eisenhower was elected
president in 1952 over Adlai E. Stevenson. Through two terms, Eisenhower hewed to moderate domestic 
policies. He sought peace through Free World strength in an era of new nationalisms, nuclear missiles, 
and space exploration. He fostered alliances pledging the United States to resist Red aggression 
in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. At home, the popular president lacked Republican congressional 
majorities after 1954, but he was reelected in 1956 by 457 electoral votes to 73 for Stevenson.
While retaining most of Truman's programs, he stressed fiscal responsibility in domestic affairs. 

Kennedy, John F. (1961 - 63)
============================
John Fitzgerald Kennedy was the first Roman Catholic elected president of the United States.
He brought to the White House the dynamic idea of a New Frontier approach in dealing with 
problems at home and abroad. Out of his leadership came the 10-year Alliance for Progress
and the Peace Corps. Failure of the U.S.-supported Cuban invasion in April 1961 led to 
the entrenchment of the Communist-backed Castro regime. When it became known that 
Soviet offensive missiles were being installed in Cuba in 1962, Kennedy ordered a naval quarantine 
of the island and moved troops into position to eliminate this threat to U.S. security. Kennedy
was assassinated in 1963.

Johnson, Lyndon (1963 - 69)
===========================
Taking office after the death of JFK, Johnson lead congress to adopt a far-reaching civil-rights bill,
a voting-rights bill, a Medicare program for the aged, and measures to improve education and 
conservation. Congress also began what Johnson described as an all-out war on poverty.
Johnson was elected president in his own right in 1964, defeating Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona.
The controversy of a war in Southeast Asia and urban riots at home marked Johnson's last two years
in office. Faced with disunity in the nation and challenges within his own party, Johnson surprised 
the country with the announcement that he would not be a candidate for reelection.

Nixon, Richard (1969 - 74)
==========================
Elected in 1968 on a campaign to end the war in Vietnam, Nixon pursued the process of 
equipping South Vietnamese to do their own fighting. American ground combat forces in Vietnam fell 
steadily from 540,000 when Nixon took office to none in 1973 when the military draft was ended. But 
there was heavy continuing use of U.S. air power. Nixon improved relations with Moscow and China, becoming
the first president to visit Peking. Inflation was an issue for Nixon, but he failed to master it as 
president. Nixon was elected by a landslide in 1972, but his involvement with the Watergate cover-up led 
to his resignation in 1974.

Ford, Gerald (1974 - 77)
========================
Nominated by Nixon to fill in the vice presidency left vacant by Spirow Agnew's resignation, Ford
assumed the presidency following Nixon's resignation. Ford's short term in office was marked
by his decision to grant a full and unconditional pardon to Nixon. He was defeated in the
1976 election by Jimmy Carter.

Carter, Jimmy (1977 - 81)
=========================
Riding the wave of popular resentment of the Nixon pardon, Carter was elected in 1976 over Gerald Ford.
Carter's term in office was marked by economic turmoil and setbacks in foreign policy. Carter's greatest
achievement was to mediate a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel; however that accomplishment was
later overshadowed by his inability to successfully find a resolution to the Iranian hostage crisis.
With the economy in shambles, Carter lost his bid for reelection to Ronad Reagan.

Reagan, Ronald (1981 - 89)
==========================
Elected in 1980, Reagan sought to bring the economy around through a supply side economic program 
designed to stimulate production and control inflation through tax cuts and sharp reductions in 
government spending. Barely three months into his first term, Reagan was the target of an assassin's 
bullet; his courageous comeback won public admiration. With the economy enjoying a full-blown recovery
despite a growing deficit, Reagan's popularity with the public dipped sharply in 1986 when the 
Iran-Contra scandal broke. However Reagan perhaps will be best remembered for his efforts in curtailing
intermediate-range missiles and his outspoken advocacy for freedom behind the Iron Curtain.

Bush, George H. W. (1989 - 93)
==============================
Elected in what was deemed Reagan's Third Term, Bush oversaw the fall of communism and the dissolution of
the Soviet Union. With a series a foreign policy triumphs behind him, Bush was beset with difficulties
on the domestic front as the economy slipped into recession. In 1991, Iraq invaded Kuwait, leading
Bush to assemble an international coalition to defeat Iraq and restore the borders. Economic concerns
however led to his defeat in the 1992 election.

Clinton, William J. (1993 - 2001)
=================================
Elected on a pledge to restore economic good fortune, Clinton oversaw a seven-year economic expansion
that resulted in a decrease in unemployment and a decrease in the deficit. However, Clinton experienced
a setback as the Republicans won control of both houses of congress in 1994. In 1996, aided
by a booming economy, Clinton was reelected over Sen. Bob Dole. Clinton's second term proved to be a
controversial one. Beset with questions involving his character and honesty, 
Clinton was impeached for his perjury in a civil trial over his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
While he was never convicted, Clinton remains only the second president to suffer impeachment.
