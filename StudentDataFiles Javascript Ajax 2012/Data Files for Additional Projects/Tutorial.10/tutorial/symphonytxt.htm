   <h2>Symphony</h2>
   <p>Orchestral composition consisting usually of four contrasting sections, 
      or movements. The term was first applied in the 16th century to the 
      instrumental interludes in such musical forms as the cantata, opera, and 
      oratorio. By 1740 the symphony had become the principal genre of orchestral 
      music, and important centers of composition arose in Mannheim, Germany; 
      Berlin; and Vienna.
