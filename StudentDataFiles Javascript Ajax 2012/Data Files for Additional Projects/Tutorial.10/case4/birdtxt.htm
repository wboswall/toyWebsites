      Now a museum, the Birdcage was once 
      the &quot;bawdiest, most wicked honky-tonk&quot; in America 
      (New York Times). Miners - and other folks - would drop in
      to the Birdcage for a drink, a show, gambling, and any of
      a number of other vices. You should also drop in to see one
      of the most interesting displays of old west memorabilia you'll
      find anywhere.
