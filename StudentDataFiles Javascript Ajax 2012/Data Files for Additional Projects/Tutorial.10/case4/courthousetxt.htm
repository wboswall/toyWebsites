      The Tombstone courthouse was the center of
      justice for all of Cochise County in its early years. The building 
      was erected in 1882 and still stands today as a testament to the 
      days when Tombstone was much wilder. The county seat (and its 
      court) moved many years ago, but the building has since become 
      a State Park with a museum that contains an interesting collection 
      of old west memorabilia.
