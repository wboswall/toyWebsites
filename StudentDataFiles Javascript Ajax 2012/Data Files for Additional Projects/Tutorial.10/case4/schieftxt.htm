      In 1877, Ed Schieffelin began prospecting in the hills around 
      what was to become Tombstone. Soldiers stationed nearby told him all he 
      would ever find was his own tombstone. He soon found an outcropping of 
      silver and the rush was on. Remembering the prophecy of the soldiers, 
      Schieffelin named his claim, and the future town, &quot;Tombstone.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>When he died in 1897, he requested to be buried in Tombstone. 
      He is now buried under a monument that is about 25 feet tall and shaped 
      like an old miner's claim - a fitting end to the man who was warned he 
      would only find his own tombstone.
