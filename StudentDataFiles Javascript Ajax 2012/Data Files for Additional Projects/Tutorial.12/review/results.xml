         <description>All Pro cornerback Ryan Inkweller of the Detroit
                      Lions left during the second quarter of the
                      Lions/Vikings game with what team officials called
                      a sprained knee. His return is questionable.

         <title>Bears Beat Texans</title>
         <link>http://www.sbloggernewslinks.com/games/nfl/nfl0113.html</link>
         <description>Visiting Chicago triumphed over host Houston, 13 - 10
                      in a game marred by a controversial interference
                      penalty in the last minute. Holding a 10 - 6 lead,
                      Texans' cornerback was flagged for interference in the
                      endzone on a pass play to Bear wide receiver Troy Milton.
                      Bears' running back Gary Vinter scored from the two yard line 
                      on the next play to seal the win. With the victory, the
                      Bears and the Texans both move to 2 - 2 for the season.
