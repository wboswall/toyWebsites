<p class="com">This is a classic touring bike. The geometry is more upright than 
   standard tourers, but it's easy to adjust to. I found the steering
   to be very responsive, even when loaded, which was a pleasant surprise.
   All the components are good quality. I use this bike for commuting as
   well as weekend tours, mostly on country roads.

<p class="com">I'm looking forward to doing a tour around Lake Michigan with this bike
   next spring. I expect it to perform like a champ.

<p class="com">I love my Tour 250! We have done 5,500 miles together, with lots more planned. 
   Only basic maintenance in all that time. Great ride, great bike. If you are looking 
   for something for the long haul this is it. Strongly recommend!

<p class="com">I needed a good road bike for Colorado and I thought the Tour 250 was the answer. 
   While it is a durable bike for pulling trailers or hanging panniers, I think there 
   are several areas that need attention. First - a more upright posture or include 
   an adjustable stem as standard. Second - the cassette should be 11-34 instead of 
   11-32. Three - they should offer/provide a front rack instead of having to find 
   one that works.
</p>
<p class="com">The new model geometry looks better than previous editions offered by Pedal Mart, 
   so perhaps some other improvements are in the works. At this point though,
   while I think this is a good bike, I can't recommend it over similarly priced
   competition.
