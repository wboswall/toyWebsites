About the Amistad Case
=======================

In 1839, the Spanish slave ship Amistad set sail from Havana to Puerto Principe, Cuba carrying 53 Africans who, 
a few months earlier, had been abducted from their homeland to be sold as slaves. En route the captives rebelled 
against the crew killing several members of the crew including the ship's captain. One of the crew members
spared by the Africans was the ship's navigator who was ordered to sail the ship back to Africa.

Instead of returning to Africa, the navigator sailed the Amistad to the northwest where it was seized by the U.S.
Navy off the coast of Long Island. The Africans were quickly seized and sent to New Haven where they were put
on trial for murder and piracy.

The case became a sensation pitting slavery advocates against abolitionists. Slavery advocates argued that the
Africans should be punished for rebellion and quickly returned to Cuba in slavery. Abolitionists pointed out
that since importation of slaves from Africa had been outlawed, the Africans were freemen who had been
illegally kidnapped and had the right to fight for their freedom, even to point of murdering their
captors.

The case eventually found its way to U.S. Supreme Court where the African's case was argued by former U.S.
President, John Quincy Adams. Adams prevailed and the Africans were set free, returning to Sierra
Leone in 1842.

About the Artist
================
The sketches presented here were made by William H. Townsend, a resident of New Haven, Connecticut. Townsend 
drew these pen-and-ink sketches of the Amistad captives as they were awaiting trial. He was 18 years
old when he completed the sketches. The 22 Townsend drawings were presented to Yale University in 1934 by 
Asa G. Dickerman, whose grandmother was the artist's cousin. The drawings are now part of the general
collection in Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Libary.
